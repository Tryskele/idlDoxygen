This is a set of files including a ruby script, doxygen template 
configuration file and several sample IDL code that will serve you as 
a guide to transfer your IDL code to something that Doxygen can parse 
in order to generate documentation. 

Note that IDL stands for Interactive Data Language, 
not to be confused with Interface Description Language!
